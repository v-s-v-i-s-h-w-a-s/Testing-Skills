# GitHub Actions Basics Course - Maintainer Guide

This document provides information for instructors and maintainers of the GitHub Actions Basics course.

## Course Overview

This course teaches students how to:

1. Set up GitHub Actions workflows
2. Implement CI/CD pipelines
3. Apply AGILE-SCRUM methodologies
4. Follow software engineering best practices

## Course Structure

The course is divided into five steps:

1. **Setup Repository**: Introduction to GitHub Actions and creating the first workflow
2. **CI Workflow**: Building a continuous integration workflow
3. **CD Workflow**: Implementing continuous deployment
4. **AGILE-SCRUM**: Using GitHub for project management
5. **Best Practices**: Optimizing workflows and finalizing the course

## Technical Implementation

The course is implemented using:

- GitHub Actions workflows that validate student progress
- Markdown files for step instructions
- Example code for JavaScript/Node.js applications
- Bot interactions that provide feedback

## Customization Options

### Modifying Course Content

To modify course content, edit the following files:

1. **Step instructions**: `.github/steps/*.md`
2. **Workflows**: `.github/workflows/*.yml`
3. **Bot responses**: `response.json`
4. **Course configuration**: `course.yml`

### Adding New Steps

To add a new step:

1. Create a new step file in `.github/steps/`
2. Add a corresponding workflow file in `.github/workflows/`
3. Update the `course.yml` configuration
4. Add responses in `response.json`

### Changing Programming Language

The course currently uses JavaScript/Node.js. To change to another language:

1. Update example code in the `examples/` directory
2. Modify workflow files to use appropriate actions for the language
3. Update step instructions to reflect the new language

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow not triggering**: Check event triggers and branch names
2. **Failed validations**: Review the specific validation steps in the workflows
3. **Bot responses not appearing**: Verify the issue numbers and response templates

### Debugging Tools

- GitHub Actions logs provide detailed information on workflow execution
- Repository events can be monitored in the "Insights" tab
- Webhook deliveries can be inspected in repository settings

## Best Practices for Instructors

1. **Monitor Progress**: Use GitHub's project board to track student progress
2. **Provide Additional Support**: Create discussion threads for common questions
3. **Gather Feedback**: Use issues to collect feedback for course improvement
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep the course content current with latest GitHub features

## Course Maintenance Schedule

- **Monthly**: Check for deprecated GitHub Actions or API changes
- **Quarterly**: Update examples to use latest best practices
- **Yearly**: Full review of course content and structure

## Adding New Features

To add new features to the course:

1. Create a development branch
2. Implement and test the new feature
3. Update documentation
4. Submit a pull request for review
5. After approval, merge and release
